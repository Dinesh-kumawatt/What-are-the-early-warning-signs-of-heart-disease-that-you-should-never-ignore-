Heart disease often develops silently — and that’s what makes it so dangerous. Many people ignore the early signs, thinking it's just tiredness or indigestion. But these small symptoms can actually be your heart’s way of warning you before a serious issue like a heart attack strikes.

So, let’s break it down: What are the top early signs of heart disease you should never ignore?

1. Chest Discomfort or Pain (Angina)
This is the most well-known symptom. You may feel tightness, pressure, heaviness, or burning in the chest — especially after physical activity or stress. It doesn’t always feel like a sharp pain. Sometimes, it feels more like “an elephant sitting on your chest.”

2. Shortness of Breath
If you’re getting out of breath just walking up stairs or during mild activities, it could be your heart struggling to pump blood efficiently. It’s not always lung-related — shortness of breath is a major sign of heart failure or blocked arteries.

3. Unexplained Fatigue
Feeling unusually tired, even after getting enough sleep or rest? Constant fatigue can be your body’s way of saying the heart isn’t pumping blood effectively to the muscles and brain. This is especially common in women with heart issues.

4. Irregular Heartbeat or Palpitations
That fluttering feeling in your chest? Occasional skipped beats are normal, but frequent or prolonged palpitations might point to arrhythmia — a heart rhythm disorder that needs medical attention.

5. Pain in the Arms, Neck, Jaw, or Back
Surprisingly, heart-related pain doesn’t always stay in the chest. It can radiate to the arms (especially the left), neck, jaw, or back. These areas might ache or feel heavy, especially during exertion.

When Should You See a Doctor?
You shouldn’t wait for all five symptoms to show up. Even one or two persistent signs could mean your heart is under stress. It’s better to get evaluated early than ignore the symptoms until it’s too late.
